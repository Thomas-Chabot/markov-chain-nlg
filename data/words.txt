Despite how it very much looked, Erik Karlsson claims he was not uncomfortable being next to Eugene Melnyk in the Senators team photo that was splashed on a strong and controversial front page of Thursday’s Ottawa Sun.

When somebody used the word tact, as in lack thereof, I thought I heard tack, as in Karlsson might have been sitting on one.

But I checked and he says he wasn’t.

“I think if you put a camera on anyone for 25 minutes you can find five seconds of any sort of footage that you want,” Karlsson said.  “It was a team photo (that), like everybody else, I’ve been in before. You smile for the camera, take a few photos.

“It’s a little bit annoying to sit still for a long time. Nothing really other than that.”

The picture generated much conversation throughout the day, which is what the picture on the front page of a good tabloid should do. And while I believe Karlsson’s explanation, I think people calling it an “unfair” photo isn’t exactly fair either.

For one thing, video on TSN made it look like Karlsson was more than a little bit annoyed with a dragged out session, so it wasn’t like a brief moment captured in time. But I don’t think he was sitting there the whole time thinking ‘I can not stand this guy to my left.’

However, I do believe Karlsson is not a Melnyk fan, if only based on the way his good friend Daniel Alfredsson walked way from the organization twice and comments that were made after Kyle Turris was traded — both by Turris’ wife and Karlsson himself.

So the photo might have, in fact, it been a perfect illustration of the relationship between the captain and the owner.

Asked again if he found it awkward sitting between Melnyk and GM Pierre Dorion — the two guys who control his future — Karlsson shrugged.

“Ah, not really,” he said. “I’ve been sitting next to them for quite some time now. I don’t think that it changed now either. I’m worried about doing as well as I can on the ice. The rest of it will take care of itself.”

Did it cross his mind that it might be the last time he sits in on a Senators team photo?

“Not until now, when you mentioned it,” Karlsson said. “I did not think about that. As of right now, I’m going to worry about playing this season, doing as good as we possibly can, to end the year that we’ve had.

“I think that once the summer comes around, I think things will maybe change a little bit, or the reports are going to change a little bit. That’s something we’re going to have to deal with.

“I still have another year on my deal and I’m committed to being here. That’s what I’m focusing on right now.”

In the meantime, with so much uncertainly in the air at Canadian Tire Centre, the team photo will remain very much out of focus.

STARTS AND STOPS: A meeting of the two last-place teams in the conference brought the expected — a small and largely quiet crowd — and all the mistakes of a shinny game on a frozen pond … Early in the day, Karlsson was asked if it was tough playing in front of fans that want the team to improve its lottery chances. “I think as a fan, obviously, it’s going to be a little bit of mixed emotions,” he said. “But I do think that in here, as it is with every team, I’m pretty sure you play to win games, whether you want to get the first overall or not. I’m never going to play on a team where you don’t go into every game to try and win it, and that’s what we’re going to do for the rest of the year. Hopefully, we win all of them.” …. For the life of me, I can not understand how Max McCormick, who has a one-way contract next season, is a healthy scratch while Jim O’Brien, who has no future in Ottawa, is in the lineup.

BETWEEN PERIODS: A fan holding a sign near the Buffalo bench was directed at Sabres defenceman Rasmus Ristolainen. “Give me your stick and I will dump my boyfriend,” it read. As far as I could tell, it was not confiscated … Would have enjoyed hearing the exchange between Mike Hoffman and Robin Lehner after the Senators winger laid a puck on the goal line that his buddy lunged back to grab. Hoffman had a good laugh about it …Need to ask Matt Duchene if he called for the back pass Sabres defenceman Justin Falk gave him behind the net before he set up Ryan Dzingel’s first of the night. There can be no other explanation for such sloppiness from a veteran of 260 NHL games … Karlsson and Hoffman drew the assists, but Duchene made the strong play keeping the puck in the zone leading to Dzingel’s second.

POINT BLANK: Mark Stone’s vision was evident on a very quick and incredible pass from the Sabres goal line to Mark Borowiecki, who was just inside the blue line. Remember it? Just before Borowiecki skated across the ice to drill Kyle Okposo into the boards … Okposo’s night got worse when he accidentally ran into Bobby Ryan in the neutral zone. Ryan checked his hand for injury, while Okposo lay on the ice then finally left for the room, done for the night …. Craig Anderson was having a pretty good first period until Marco Scandella beat him with a spin-around slapshot from the blue line that beat him to the glove side. It was his 14th test of the night …
