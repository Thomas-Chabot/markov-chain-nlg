# markov-chain-nlg
A simple Markov Chain text generator developed in Node.JS.


## installation
Download the cope repository & run npm init from the command line.

## usage
The code can be used either on its own (by running server.js) or as an additional module for another app (using main.js).

### Server.js
The simpler method to use the code is to run server.js. This is the default for npm start.

### main.js
If you would like to run the app without a server, then it's possible to do so by requiring main.js.
This will export a variety of functions, described below, which can then be used to generate text.
